# JaVelo: Advanced Bicycle Route Planner

## Overview
JaVelo is a Java application developed to offer precise and efficient bike route planning, optimized for the diverse Swiss terrain. Built with a focus on user interaction and topographical accuracy, JaVelo integrates advanced algorithms to simulate real-world conditions, much like popular map services but with a focus on cyclists.

The graphical user interface, crafted with JavaFX, delivers an intuitive and interactive experience, allowing users to plan routes dynamically while considering factors such as terrain and elevation.

## Technical Highlights
- **JavaFX**: Used to create a seamless and interactive interface, allowing users to explore and modify routes in real-time.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Implemented for optimal route calculation, tailored to the unique challenges of cycling through varying elevations and terrains.
- **Dynamic Route Management**: Users can easily add, remove, or adjust waypoints, with the route recalculating instantly based on changes.
- **Detailed Route Profiles**: Users can view total distance, elevation gains, and losses for any planned route.

## Features
- Interactive map for planning routes with multiple waypoints, specifically tailored to cycling in Switzerland.
- Optimal route calculation that accounts for road types, bike paths, and topographical data.
- Real-time route updates when waypoints are added or adjusted.
- Detailed analysis of route elevation, distance, and difficulty.

## Example
The following is an example of a planned bike route around Lausanne, showcasing the real-time map interface and the elevation profile of the route:
